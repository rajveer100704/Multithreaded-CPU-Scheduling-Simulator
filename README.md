üñ•Ô∏è Multithreaded CPU Scheduling Simulator (C++17)

A lightweight C++17 simulator demonstrating classic Operating System CPU scheduling algorithms with multithreaded worker threads:

‚úÖ Round Robin (RR)

‚úÖ Shortest Job First (SJF) (non-preemptive)

‚úÖ Priority Scheduling (non-preemptive, smaller number = higher priority)

This project showcases Operating System fundamentals relevant for roles like NVIDIA SWE Intern:

Multiprocessing & scheduling

Memory management concepts

Synchronization & parallelism

System-level programming with C++17
